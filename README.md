# YouTube Error 404 Page
Hello everyone! This is my 2nd project and at this poject, I created the YouTube error 404' webpage. This webpage appears when you serach for any addres doesn't exists after "youtube.com/".

To compare my project with this page, open it first in another browser window

# How I'd created this project?
  1. First, I search in my browser for "youtube.com/xxxxxxx";
  2. I downloaded all images I could in the page;
  3. Created an "index.html" and "style.css" file into a directory
  4. In html file, I insert the image, YouTube logo, the <p> text, a search bar and search button;
  5.Styled all of them in the css file and done!
  
 If you want to modify anything, just download the html and css file and the images into the file, I hope you liked it :)
